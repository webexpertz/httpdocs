      <h3>Page 4: The Earth's climate</h3>
      <div>The term 'climate' is used as a short hand way of summarising the weather experienced over a particular period of time. This typically
        includes information &#8211; the average conditions, range and frequency of extremes for example &#8211; about temperature, precipitation, wind and other weather-related quantities over a period of time, ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. For more details see the <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/faqs.php">frequently asked questions</a> from the <a href="http://www.wmo.int">World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</a> and the <a href="https://www.rmets.org/briefing-papers">climate briefing papers</a> from the the <a href="http://www.rmets.org">Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS)</a>.
        <p> The diameter of the Earth (12, 742 km) and an apple (80 mm) are approximately one thousand times the depth of the layer of the atmosphere, known as the 'troposphere', in which most weather systems reside (12 km) and the apple skin (0.08 mm), respectively. For further details of the greenhouse effect see Frequently Asked Question 1.3 from Working Group 1 of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-3.html">IPCC AR4 WG1 FAQ1.3</a> and this article on the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/">basics of climate change</a> from the <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org">Royal Society</a>. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane and nitrous oxide. Unlike the other greenhouse gases, water vapour is not considered a pollutant in this context. This is because the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is variable, being strongly dependent on temperature, and is primarily a consequence of evaporation from the oceans.
        
        <p> For the latest update on the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere see the <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ghg/GHGbulletin.html">WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin</a>.
        
        <p> For more details of the observed changes and their impacts see, Summary for Policymakers (SPM), Synthesis Report (SYR), of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5): <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">IPCC AR5 SYR SPM</a>.

      <h3>Page 5: Observing the Earth's atmosphere from space</h3>
      <div> The US <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</a> measures various aspects of the Earth's atmosphere (composition, temperature, rainfall etc) from space using satellites such as the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/oco2">Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO)-2</a>, which measures carbon dioxide. The <a href="http://www.esa.int">European Space Agency (ESA)</a> also has a series of <a href=" http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus">satellites</a> measuring the composition of the Earth's atmosphere.

      <h3>Page 6: A warming world</h3>
      <div>The global temperature record produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit (<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/">HadCRUT4</a>) shows that 2015 was 0.75 &plusmn; 0.1&deg;C above the long-term (1961-1990) average, a record since at least 1850.  When compared with the pre-industrial period, the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2016/2015-global-temperature">2015 average global temperature was around 1&deg;C above the long-term average from 1850 to 1900</a>. Other groups also produce surface temperature datasets, for example the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (<a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">NASA GISS</a>) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Climatic Data Center (<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php">NOAA NCDC</a>). These are produced separately to HadCRUT4 and use different methodologies but provide similar results. CarbonBrief has produced an explainer of what temperature records from <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-surface-and-satellite-temperature-records-compare">surface measurements and satellites</a> tell us. Gridded <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/monitoring/climate/surface-temperature">maps<a> show that some regions have warmed more than others, in particular the Arctic region has seen significantly greater warming than the global average.
        <p> A natural weather cycle known as <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/elnino/what-is-el-nino">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> added to the warmth of 2015 and 2016 but the greatest contribution to these record warm years is thought to have been <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-did-el-nino-boost-global-temperature-in-2015">long-term climate change arising from increasing greenhouse gases</a>. Current projections from the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk">Met Office</a> suggest that <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2016/global-forecast-2017">2017 will be another very warm year globally</a> but is unlikely to be a new record due to the absence of additional warming from El Ni&ntilde;o.
        
        <p>For a full assessment of the temperature changes since 1850 and other recent climatic changes see the IPCC's Summary for Policymakers <a href=" http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf">IPCC, AR5, WG1, SPM</a>.

      <h3>Page 7: The surface temperature over land and sea</h3>
      <div> Data plotted in the figure comes from the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/">HadCRUT4</a> dataset of global surface temperatures. This combines the <a href=" http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/crutem4/">CRUTEM4</a> land-surface air temperature dataset and the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/">HadSST3</a> sea-surface temperature dataset. The sea-surface measurements come from ships and buoys.
        <p>The temperature data is shown as the increase since 1850-1900. While late 19th century temperatures are commonly taken to be indicative of pre-industrial, there is no fixed period that is used as standard. There are limitations in available data in the earlier instrumental record, making the average temperature in the reference period less certain. Therefore 1850-1900 is chosen here as the most reliable reference period, which also corresponds to the period chosen by IPCC to represent a suitable earlier reference period. For alternative visualisations of this data and details of the uncertainty ranges see <a href=" https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/~timo/diag/tempdiag.htm"> Prof Tim Osborn's website</a>.
        
        <p>Arctic sea ice has seen a strong decrease in extent over recent years. Data is available from the US <a href=" http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a>. Research ships, such as the <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/rrs-sir-david-attenborough/">RRS Sir David Attenborough</a> which is currently being built, monitor changes to our oceans and conduct targeted measurements aimed at improving our understanding of the climate system. In addition, thousands of robotic floats sample the ocean depths around the world every day.

      <h3>Page 8: Melting ice and rising sea levels</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The average extent of <a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/">Arctic sea ice</a> at its annual summer minimum for the years 1979-2000 was 6.7 million square kilometres. In 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016 the minimum extent did not reach above 4.6 million square kilometres. This reduction of 2.1 million square kilometres is equivalent to the combined area of the UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. To date the record minimum extent, 3.39 million square kilometres, was reached in 2012. Data for sea ice volume (extent and thickness) are available from the <a href="http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/">Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS)</a>. Much on-going research is focused on understanding the possible connection between Arctic sea ice and changes to weather across Europe, Asia and North America. See for example <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00822.1">Overland et al., The Melting Arctic and Midlatitude Weather Patterns: Are They Connected? <i>Journal of Climate</i>, 2015</a> also <a href=" http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.337/abstract">Barnes, E. A. and Screen, J. A. The impact of Arctic warming on the midlatitude jet-stream: Can it? Has it? Will it? <i>WIREs Clim Change</i>, 2015</a>.
        <p> The two major causes of <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html">sea level rise</a> are thermal expansion caused by warming of the oceans (since water expands as it warms) and the loss of land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets, due to increased melting. For further details see <a href=" http://www.pnas.org/content/113/6/1504.abstract">Rietbroek et al., Revisiting the contemporary sea-level budget on global and regional scales, <i>PNAS</i>, 2016</a>. Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass and since 1992 the polar ice sheets have contributed, on average, 0.59 &plusmn; 0.20 mm per year to the rate of global sea-level rise (see <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183">Shepherd et al., A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance, <i>Science</i>, 2012)</a>. In addition, glaciers have shrunk almost worldwide (see <a href=" http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2863.html">Roe, Baker and Herla, Centennial glacier retreat as categorical evidence of regional climate change, <i>Nature Geoscience</i>, 2016</a>). Since the mid-19th century, sea levels have been rising at an increasing rate, see data from <a href="http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_data_cmar.html">tide gauges</a>, based on <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-011-9119-1">Church and White, Sea-level rise from the late 19th to the early 21st Century, <i>Surveys in Geophysics</i>, 2011</a> and from <a href="http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level.html">satellites</a>. <a href="http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level.html">Satellite data</a> shows that some places have seen more sea level rise than others, as expected from our understanding of the physics. For further details of changes to ice and sea level see <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf">IPCC AR5 WG1 SPM</a>.
        <p> The growing exposure to flooding of coastal cities and the cost of flood defences is documented in <a href=" http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n9/full/nclimate1979.html">Hallegatte et al, Future flood losses in major coastal cities, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, 2013</a>. Average economic losses from flooding worldwide totalled US&#36;6bn in 2005. Even with new investment in flood protection measures this is expected to rise substationally by 2050; without such investment, the study finds that annual losses could exceed USS&#36;1 trillion per year.  A perspective from the insurance industry is given in the Allianz Risk Pulse report <a href="https://www.allianz.com/v_1448643898000/media/press/document/Allianz_Risk_Pulse_Megacities_20151130-EN.pdf">The megacity state</a>. Hurricane/Post Tropical Strom Sandy struck the New Jersey coast on October 29, 2012, inflicting billions of dollars of damage to residential and commercial facilities as well as transportation and other infrastructure along the coastline and well into the interior of the states impacted. For a final damage report see <a href="http://www.esa.gov/sites/default/files/sandyfinal101713.pdf">The Economic Impact of Hurrricane Sandy</a> from the US Department of Commerce.
        <p> The Environment Agency has produced a detailed strategic flood risk management plan for London and the Thames estuary through to the end of the century <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/322061/LIT7540_43858f.pdf">Thames Estuary 2100: Managing flood risk through London and the Thames Estuary, Environment Agency, 2012</a>, see also the <a href=" http://www.ice2sea.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/05/From_Ice_to_High_Seas.pdf">ice2sea project report</a>, which notes that with a sea-level rise of 100cm flooding would exceed the Thames Barrier an average of once in 12 years.

      <div>Sea level rise has the potential to increase the risk of storm surges. A study (<a href=" http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/1/014032">Tebaldi, Strauss and Zervas, Modelling sea level rise impacts on storm surges along US coasts, <i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 2012</a>) of the US coastline which combined future global sea level rise projections with historic tide gauge water levels at 55 sites, found that for about one third of the areas considered, today's 'once in a century' storm surges may become 'once in a decade' storms in future.

Note that it has not been possible to determine conclusively whether or not climate change increased the risk of the Pakistan floods in 2010, see <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00169.1">Christadis et al, A New HadGEM3-A-Based System for Attribution of Weather- and Climate-Related Extreme Events, <i>Journal of Climate</i>, 2013</a>.

        <p> It has been estimated that the return time for a European heatwave of the magnitude of 2003 reduced from thousands of years at the end of last century (1990-99) to tens or hundreds of years (best estimate of 127 years) by the decade 2003-2012, see <a href=" http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n1/full/nclimate2468.html">Christidis et al, Dramatically increasing chance of extremely hot summers since the 2003 European heatwave, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, 2015</a>. Heatwaves in the UK like that experienced in 2003 are expected to become the norm in summer by the 2040s. The average number of hot days per year has been increasing since the 1960s, and currently 2,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK from heat-related conditions. The growing, ageing population means the number of vulnerable people at risk is increasing. In combination this means the number of premature heat-related deaths is expected to more than triple by the 2050s. The impacts will not be limited to southern England. There is evidence that newer homes are at a greater risk of overheating than older designs. Delayed introduction of policies to ensure that homes, hospitals, care facilities, schools and prisons, and business premises, are safe and operable in high temperatures will increase risks and lead to longer-term wellbeing impacts.
        
        <p>A number of studies have found an increased risk of specific floods as a consequence of climate change, for example <a href=" http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2927.html">Schaller et al, Human influence on climate in the 2014 southern England winter floods and their impacts, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, 2016</a>, <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411004033">Kay et al, Attribution of Autumn/Winter 2000 flood risk in England to anthropogenic climate change: A catchment-based study, <i>Journal of Hydrology</i>, 2011</a> and <a href=" http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09762.html"> Pall et al, Anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood risk in England and Wales in autumn 2000, <i>Nature</i>, 2011</a>.

        Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017</a> found that the greatest direct climate change-related threats for the UK are large increases in flood risk and exposure to high temperatures and heatwaves, shortages in water, substantial risks to UK wildlife and natural ecosystems, risks to domestic and international food production and trade, and risks from new and emerging pests and diseases. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall and more frequent flooding, including outside of recognised flood risk areas. Higher temperatures will affect public health, infrastructure, business, farming, forestry and the natural environment. Dry periods, when combined with higher temperatures, are likely to result in more severe and prolonged droughts. Projected sea level rise of 50-100 centimetres by 2100 will exacerbate flood risks and accelerate the process of coastal change for exposed communities. A study has shown that climate change likely increased the risk of floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 90 per cent, see <a href=" http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09762.html">Pall et al, Anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood risk in England and Wales in autumn 2000, <i>Nature</i>, 2011</a>.
        <p> The impacts of flooding and coastal change in the UK are already significant and are expected to increase as a result of climate change. Improving flood protection for some communities will be possible, whilst others will face the prospect of significantly increased risks. This will affect property values, business revenues and in extreme cases the viability of communities. Risks to communities and local economies are closely linked to the resilience of local infrastructure, in particular energy, transportation and communications systems.
        <p>The floods of <a href=" http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/autumn2000.html">autumn 2000</a> were particularly severe. The worst affected areas were Kent and Sussex during October, and Shropshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire during November. Further information concerning the flooding in Uckfield, Sussex is provided by the <a href="http://www.geography.org.uk/resources/flooding/uckfield/">Geographical Association</a>. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/969850.stm”>BBC News website from 13 October 2000</a> describes the flooding in Uckfield and the rescue by lifeboat of men, women and children trapped in a town centre supermarket and of residents in flats above the shops. Uckfield TV has produced a compilation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe0YaTgB_io&t=4s”>news reels from the Uckfield floods in autumn 2000</a> highlighting the rescue efforts of the emergency services.</p>
        
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/UK-CCRA-2017-Synthesis-Report-Committee-on-Climate-Change.pdf">UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017</a>:</p>

            &#8226; Heatwaves in the UK like that experienced in 2003 are expected to become the norm in summer by the 2040s. The average number of hot days per year has been increasing since the 1960s, and currently 2,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK from heat-related conditions.

Combining these factors, this means the number of premature heat-related deaths is expected to more than triple by the 2050s.</br>&nbsp;</br>
           &#8226; There is a risk of shortages in water supply for the public, agriculture, energy generation and industry, with impacts on freshwater ecology. In addition, climate change presents a substantial risk to the UK's native wildlife and to the vital goods and services provided by natural capital, including food, timber and fibre, clean water, carbon storage, and the cultural benefits derived from landscapes.</br>&nbsp;</br>
            &#8226; Extreme weather events affecting international production, trade and supply chains could make food prices volatile with occasional spikes. Longer term incremental changes in climate are likely to alter the agricultural productivity of regions that are important for global food production. There is the potential for domestic production to increase in a warmer climate but this will be constrained unless more action is taken to address the declining quality of soils and projected water deficits in the most productive UK regions.</br>&nbsp;</br>
            &#8226; Furthermore, the impacts of new and emerging pests and diseases are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants. The warmer, wetter conditions expected with climate change will allow some pests and diseases to extend their range. Disease outbreaks are difficult to predict, have widespread direct as well as indirect impacts on communities and economies, and are very expensive to manage once established.

      <div> The range of risks and impacts that can be expected to accompany climate change are detailed in <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf">IPCC AR5 WG2 SPM</a>. Various studies have investigated the influence of climate change and climate variability on crop yields, for example <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n4/full/nclimate2153.html">Challinor et al., A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation, <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6989">Ray et al., Climate variation explains a third of global crop yield variability, <i>Nature Communications</i>, 2015. The <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf">IPCC AR5 WG2 SPM</a> concluded with high confidence that based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts. Furthermore, for the major crops (wheat, rice, and maize) in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of two degrees C or more above late-20th-century levels, although individual locations may benefit.
        <p>The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation sets out the evidence as to how climate change brings a cascade of risks from physical impacts to ecosystems, agro-ecosystems, agricultural production, food chains, incomes and trade, with economic and social impacts on livelihoods and food security and nutrition, in their 2016 report, <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5188e.pdf">Climate change and food security: risks and responses</a>.
        
        <p>Food price volatility arises from a number of factors, including those linked with climatic change. A 2011 report from the <a href=" http://www.pcfisu.org/">Prince of Wales's International Sustainability Unit</a> presents an overview of how extreme weather during recent years has led to food price volatility: <a href="http://pcfisu.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/TPC0632_Resilience_report_WEB11_07_SMALLER.pdf">What price resilience? Towards sustainable and secure food systems</a>. See also <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf">IPCC AR5 WG2 SPM</a>.
        
        <p> Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity in many countries today. Pressure on available water resources is expected to increase due to population changes, and future climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably, see for example <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3245.abstract">Schewe et al., Multimodel assessment of water scarcity under climate change, <i>PNAS</i>, 2014</a>.
        
        <p>For a review of Himalayan glaciers and the influence of climate change on regional water supplies see <a href=" http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Himalayan-Glaciers-Climate-Change-Water-Resources/13449">Himalayan Glaciers: Climate Change, Water Resources, and Water Security, <i>National Academies Press</i>, 2012</a>.
        
        <p> Climate change poses a range of threats to human health and survival in multiple, interacting ways. Impacts can be direct (e.g., heatwaves and extreme weather events such as a storm, forest fire, flood, or drought) or indirectly mediated through the effects of climate change on ecosystems (e.g., agricultural losses and changing patterns of disease), economies, and social structure (e.g., migration and conflict). Given this, the <a href=" http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60854-6/fulltext">2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change</a> concluded that 'the effects of climate change are being felt today, and future projections represent an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health'.
        
        <p>Climate change over the 21st century is projected to increase displacement of people. Moreover, climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks. The impacts of climate change on the critical infrastructure and territorial integrity of many states are expected to influence national security policies, and evidence indicates that when violent conflict occurs it increases vulnerability to climate change. For further details see <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf">IPCC AR5 WG2 SPM</a>. A number of studies have considered the role of climate change in present-day conflict and refugee situations, with mixed conclusions about the relative importance of climate change; for example <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.abstract">Kelley et al, Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought, <i>PNAS</i>, 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00263206.2013.850076">De Chatel, The Role of Drought and Climate Change in the Syrian Uprising: Untangling the Triggers of the Revolution, <i>Middle Eastern Studies</i>, 2014</a> and <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00129.1">Bergaoui et al, The contribution of human-induced climate change to the drought of 2014 in the southern Levant region, in Explaining Extreme Events of 2014 from a Climate Perspective, <i>Bulletin of American Meteorological Society</i>, 2015</a>.

      <h3>Page 13: Water supply</h3>
      <div> Climate change has the potential to impact water supply. Locations such as the Indian Himalayan region are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with population growth placing additional pressure on water resources. Freshwater supply is influenced by the amount and timing of rainfall, snow and glacial melt.

      <h3>Page 14: Disappearing wildlife</h3>
      <div> Many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change. In the past, natural changes in climate that occurred at a slower rate than the present changes caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions. A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projected climate change, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors. For further details see <a href=https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/>IPCC AR5 WG2<a>.
        <p>CarbonBrief have produced a summary report on what the current science says regarding <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/polar-bears-and-climate-change-what-does-the-science-say">polar bears and climate change</a>. The <a href="https://www.iucn.org/">International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</a> produced a report in 2009, <a href="https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2009-051.pdf">Species and climate change: more than just the polar bear</a>, which details ten flagship species, chosen as a representative sample of the sorts of species that may suffer from climate change affecting land, ocean and river habitats: staghorn corals, ringed seals, leatherback turtles, emperor penguins, quiver trees, clownfish, arctic foxes, some salmon, koalas and beluga whales.
        
        <p> Recent findings indicate that warmer and more acidic waters threaten the viability of some salmon species in some regions, see for example <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n2/full/nclimate2473.html">Munoz et al., Adaptive potential of a Pacific salmon challenged by climate change, <i>Nature Climate Change</i> 2015, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n10/full/nclimate2687.html">Ou et al., Responses of pink salmon to CO2-induced aquatic acidification, <i>Nature Climate Change</i> 2015</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12137/full">Wade et al., Steelhead vulnerability to climate change in the Pacific Northwest, <i>Journal Applied Ecology</i>, 2013</a>. Note that evidence also suggests that some salmon species may have some ability to adapt to limited temperature increases, e.g., <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5252">Anttila et al., Atlantic salmon show capability for cardiac acclimation to warm temperatures, <i>Nature Communications</i>, 2014</a>). Eastern Pacific populations of the leatherback turtle have declined by over 90&#37; during the past three decades, primarily due to human pressures including unsustainable egg harvest, development on nesting beaches, and by-catch mortality. The effects of climate change may impose additional stresses, see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064513004657">Willis-Norton et al., Climate change impacts on leatherback turtle pelagic habitat in the Southeast Pacific, <i>Deep Sea Research</i>, 2015</a>.

      <h3>Page 19: The last ice age</h3>
      <div> Detailed analyses of ocean sediments, ice cores, and other data show that the Earth has repeatedly moved between ice ages and warmer periods repeatedly over the past 2.6 million years at least, triggered by recurring variations in Earth's orbit about the Sun that primarily alter the regional and seasonal distribution of solar energy reaching Earth. These relatively small changes in solar energy are reinforced over thousands of years by gradual changes in Earth's ice cover (the cryosphere), especially over the Northern Hemisphere, and in atmospheric composition, eventually leading to large changes in global temperature. The average global temperature change during an ice-age cycle is estimated as 5&deg;C &plusmn; 1&deg;C.
        <p> The climate of the last ice age was much less stable than the Earth has experienced over the last 10,000 years. It went through a series of abrupt warming and gradual cooling oscillations known as Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, see for example <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/abrupt-climate-change-during-the-last-ice-24288097">Schmidt and Hertzberg, Abrupt Climate Change During the Last Ice Age, <i>Nature Education Knowledge</i>, 2011</a>.

      <h3>Page 24: Increasing energy demand</h3>
      <div> The 20-fold increase in global energy use since 1850 is charted in the <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Flagship-Projects/Global-Energy-Assessment/GEA-Summary-web.pdf">Global Energy Assessment, <i>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</i> 2012</a>. This also reveals the changing energy mix and how during the 20th century there was a huge increase in the consumption of fossil fuels.
        <p> The <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html">BP Statistical Review of World Energy</a> provides estimates of global primary energy use; see the IEA's <a href="https://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/unitconverter/">energy unit converter</a> for conversions between million tonnes of oil equivalent (MtOe) and exajoules (EJ). In 2015 global energy use was estimated to be: 4331 MtOe = 181 EJ (oil), 3135 MtOe = 131 EJ (gas), 3840 MtOe = 161 EJ (coal), 583 MtOe = 24 EJ (nuclear), 893 MtOe = 37 EJ (hydroelectric) and 365 MtOe = 15 EJ (renewables). The <a href="https://www.iea.org/">International Energy Agency (IEA)</a> estimates there is approximately a further 1200 MtOe = 50 EJ of energy use from non-commercial, traditional sources such as biomass; see for example their description of <a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/bioenergy/">Bioenergy</a> and <a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/key-world-energy-statistics.html">Key Energy Statistics</a>.
        
        <p> The IEA's <a href="http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/weo2015/">World Energy Outlook 2015</a> estimates that 1.2 billion people, 17&#37; of the global population, did not have access to electricity in 2013. Many more suffer from supply that is of poor quality. More than 95&#37; of those living without electricity are in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, and they are predominantly in rural areas (around 80&#37; of the world total). The <a href="http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo-2016-special-report-energy-and-air-pollution.html">World Energy Outlook Special Report 2016: Energy and Air Pollution</a> notes that energy production and use are by far the largest man-made sources of air pollutants. According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/whs2016_AnnexA_CleanHouseholdEnergy.pdf">world health statistics</a> from the <a href="http://www.who.int/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, more than 3 billion people use wood and other solid fuels for cooking, and kerosene for lighting. This creates smoky environments that are associated with around 4.3 million premature deaths each year. Coal and oil combustion in power plants, industrial facilities and vehicles is associated with outdoor pollution linked to around 3 million premature deaths each year. Jointly around <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/whs2016_AnnexA_MortalityAirPollution.pdf">6.5 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to air pollution</a>, according to the WHO.

      <h3>Page 26: Clearing forests and damaging soils</h3>
      <div> Forests were initially most extensively cleared for farming in the temperate regions. More recently forest loss has increased in tropical latitudes. For an historical perspective on forest loss see <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5588e.pdf">State of the World's Forests 2016</a> produced by the UN's <a href="http://www.fao.org/">Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</a>.
        <p> The loss of temperate forests over the past ten thousand years is discussed in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748899901895">Williams, Dark ages and dark areas: global deforestation in the deep past, <i>Journal of Historical Geography</i>, 2000</a>. For the reasons for the loss of different species of large animal, including the pressures arising from the clearance of temperate forests to make way for farming see <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-012-9558-7">Navarro and Pereira, Rewilding Abandoned Landscapes in Europe, <i>Ecosystems</i>, 2012</a>. Deforestation is a leading cause of regional species loss, see <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s5_8879.pdf">Sodhi et al., Causes and Consequences of Species Extinctions</a> in <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8879.html"><i>Princeton Guide to Ecology</i>, 2009</a>, see also <a href="http://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319222455">Daleszczyk et al., Mammal Species Extinction and Decline: Some Current and Past Case Studies of the Detrimental Influence of Man, <i>Problematic Wildlife</i>, Springer, 2016</a>.
        
        <p> Peatlands contain vast quantities of carbon. Although peatlands cover just 2-3&#37; of the Earth's land area they contain about a quarter of the world's soil carbon. Deforestation on peatlands can thus contribute very substantial emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. For an overview see <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n1/full/ngeo2325.html">Turetsky et al., Global vulnerability of peatlands to fire and carbon loss, <i>Nature Geoscience</i>, 2015</a>. A recent study estimated the carbon loss caused by coastal peat swamp forest conversion into oil palm plantation with periodic burning was 1400 tonnes of carbon per hectare over 100 years, which is equivalent to about 2900 years of carbon accumulation in a hectare of coastal peatlands, see <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12672/full">Kurnianto et al., Carbon accumulation of tropical peatlands over millennia: a modeling approach, <i>Global Change Biology</i>, 2014</a>. For a review of the peatlands of South-East Asia and the link between deforestation and drainage, and accelerating carbon emissions arising from peat mineralization and fire see <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/20150176">Page and Hooijer, In the line of fire: the peatlands of Southeast Asia, <i>Philisophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</i>, 2016</a>.
        
        <p> Forest clearance to make way for agriculture continues to add emissions to the atmosphere, with the farming sector overall contributing about a quarter of total emissions, including from the manufacture of fertilizer and release of methane from digestion by ruminant animals. For a detailed breakdown see <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter11.pdf">Smith et al,

        <p> The total allowable emissions for a likely (66&#37;) chance to keep global average temperature less than 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels is estimated to be 3670 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, which reduces to around 3000 billion tonnes when taking into account greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon dioxide. For details see <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/105004">Peters et al., Measuring a fair and ambitious climate agreement using cumulative emissions, <i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 2015</a>. Cumulative past emissions from 1870 to 2014 are estimated to be about 2000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide – in other words, we have already used about two-thirds of the carbon budget for 2&deg;C. Annual emissions in 2015 were just under 40 billion tonnes, taking into account the contributions from burning fossil fuels and cement manufacture as well as deforestation and land-use changes.

        <p> The <a href="http://uncached-site.globalcalculator.org/">Global Calculator</a> is a website that allows exploration of a low-carbon world in 2050 with different choices concerning our energy future. See <a href="http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/">2050 Energy Calculator</a> for a version focused on the UK.
        
        <p> On the potential for renewable energy to meet a very substantial proportion of global energy demand, the IPCC produced a special report in 2011 <a href="http://ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srren/SRREN_FD_SPM_final.pdf">Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation</a>, which pointed out how a range of different studies have consistently found that the total global technical potential for renewable energy is substantially higher than global energy demand.
        
        <p> Staying within low-carbon budgets requires an enormous scale up of the contribution of low-carbon emission technologies: fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS), renewable energy, bio-energy (including bio-energy with CCS), and nuclear power, see for example <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/075002">van Vuuren et al., Carbon budgets and energy transition pathways, <i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 2016</a>.

        <p> A synthesis of assessments of the value of forests is provided by <a href="http://www.teebweb.org/">The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)</a> project; see the 2010 report, <a href="http://doc.teebweb.org/wp-content/uploads/Study%20and%20Reports/Reports/Synthesis%20report/TEEB%20Synthesis%20Report%202010.pdf">Mainstreaming the economics of nature</a>. Tropical rainforests contribute to national development in the countries where they remain through replenishing freshwater, protecting against flooding, conserving biodiversity and providing forest products including food, fuel and timber. For a review of the multiple ways in which such forests (and other healthy ecosystems) contribute to economic development see <a href="https://profilebooks.com/what-has-nature-ever-done-for-us.html">Juniper, What has Nature ever done for us? <i>Profile Books</i>, 2013</a>.
        
        <p> Modern strategies for the protection of forests which, as well as providing development benefits, capture and store carbon from the atmosphere, involve assisting smallholders to adopt sustainable farming practices.

How the world's most fertile soil can help reverse climate change and reduce world hunger, <i>Greystone books</i>, 2016</a>. Soil organic matter not only holds more carbon in the ground and thus leads to less in the atmosphere, but also retains water in ways that promote crop production, including by increasing resilience to drought, see the summary on <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0100e/a0100e08.htm">creating drought-resistant soil</a> from the UN's <a href="http://www.fao.org/">Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</a>.

        <p> The <a href="http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php">Paris Agreement's</a> central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5&deg;C. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. To reach these ambitious goals, appropriate financial flows, a new technology framework and an enhanced capacity building framework will be put in place, thus supporting action by developing countries and the most vulnerable countries, in line with their own national objectives. The Agreement also provides for enhanced transparency of action and support through a more robust transparency framework. The Paris Agreement includes provision for <a href="http://unfccc.int/land_use_and_climate_change/redd/items/7377.php">combatting deforestation and forest degradation</a>; see this summary from the <a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/01/forests-are-paris-agreement-now-what">World Resources Institute</a>.
        
        <p> The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.
        
        <p> The <a href="http://www.unep.org/">United Nations Environment Programme</a> produces an annual report on global progress <a href="http://web.unep.org/emissionsgap/">emissions reductions</a>. The <a href="https://uneplive.unep.org/media/docs/theme/13/Emissions_Gap_Report_2016.pdf">Emissions Gap Report</a> highlights that even if fully implemented, the emission cuts that countries have promised to make unconditionally are only consistent with keeping global warming below 3.2&deg;C by 2100 (see also <a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/">Climate Action Tracker</a>). If developing countries receive the funds promised by rich nations and use them for additional emission constraints as they have pledged, that would shave an additional 0.2&deg;C off future temperature rise. However, studies indicate that some countries, such as China, <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/news/new-study-finds-chinas-emissions-likely-to-peak-by-2025/">are likely to cut emissions further and faster</a> than they have pledged; and in 2018 countries will review their progress, with a view to tightening constraints.
