		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<p>If Weather Display Live fails to load correctly in your web browser please
		carefully check the following -</p>
		<p><strong>Errors loading data or blank screens </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Weather Display Live requires Flash player 8 to work correctly. You can
				download this version from the Adobe website at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" target="_blank">
					http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer</a>
			<li>
				You have changed the<strong> </strong>line in the index.html file to reflect the location of your wdlconfig.xml
			file.
			<li>
				You have put the wdlv6_03.swf file and the index.html file in the same folder
				as the wdlconfig.xml and clientraw.txt file on your web server, or you've
				specified the location of the clientraw files in the wdlconfig.xml file.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p><strong>A mesage saying you need to upgrade or install Flash v8 </strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Ensure you've uploaded the swfobject.js file to the WDL location on your website.</li>
          <li>Check you have javascript enabled and flash installed in your web browser. </li>
    </ul>
		<p><strong>Error loading configuration </strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>9 times out of 10 this is because you've specified a different domain for your wdlconfig.xml file. For example you're viewing WDL in your browser at http://www.mywebsite.com but the location in your html file for the wdlconfig.xml file is http://mywebsite.com. Flash treats this as a different domain and will not load data for security reasons. To rectify this change the html line to http://www.mywebsite.com </li>
    </ul>
		<p><strong>No changes are showing in your web browser </strong></p>
		<p>If you have made changes to the wdlconfig.xml file and they are not showing up
			in your web browser this is usually because the file is being cached somewhere,
			either by your web browser or a proxy server somewhere in the chain. This is
			commonly hosted by your Internet Service Provider to reduce internet traffic.
			There are four things you can try if your browser is caching -</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Refresh the page. In Internet Explorer press F5.
			<li>
			Force a refresh of the cache in your browser. In Internet Explorer press Ctrl +
			F5
			<li>
			Restart your browser.
			<li>
				Empty your browsers cache completely. In Internet Explorer go to Tools -
				Internet Options - General and click on 'Delete Files'.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Flash will not load data files which reside in a different domain to the actual
			swf file for security reasons. Therefore make sure your swf, wdlconfig.xml and
			clientraw.txt files all reside in the same domain.		</p>
		<p>For all features to work correctly you must be using Weather Display v10.37i or
			greater.		</p>
		<p>For any other issues please post to the Weather Display forum at <a href="http://www.weather-watch.com/smf/" target="_blank">
