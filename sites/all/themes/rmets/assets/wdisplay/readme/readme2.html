		<h3>Upgrading to New Releases</h3>
		<p>New versions of Weather Display Live will be given a new name for the swf file for two reasons:
			to avoid problems with browsers caching old versions and to avoid confusion
			over which version is being used.</p>
		<p>If you are applying a new version of Weather Display Live all you need to do is
			rename the reference to it in the web page that hosts the swf file so that it
			now refences the new swf. With reference to the  section on <a href="readme1.html">
			installation</a> change the line that says -</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>var versionOfWdl = &quot;wdlv4_15.swf&quot;;</p>
	</blockquote>
		<p>to the new version  so that it now reads</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>var versionOfWdl = &quot;wdlv6_03.swf&quot;;			</p>
	</blockquote>
		<p>Upload the index.html file again to your website and refresh your browser to see the new version.	</p>
		<p>If you are using a configuration file for WDL prior to v6 then please note that many instruments will need re-positioning. This is because of changes that had to be made to WDL to be compatible with the WDL Configurator. </p>
		<p>If you use the WDL Configurator to manage your configuration files then functionality in the new release will be updated to work with the new WDL swf file. If you use an old version of either the WDL swf or the WDL Configurator then there may be compatibility issues. They are designed to work together with the same version. </p>
