<p>To allow users to upload abstracts to an event, edit the event and tick the "Allow abstract submissions" tick box
</p>
<p>
When a new abstract is created it is unpublished.  To approve it you need to publish it.  To see a list of all abstracts submitted to an event, click the "All abstracts" link in the Event management block that appears on the left column of all event pages.
</p>
<p>

Abstracts are linked directly to the event they are created from.  To list all the approved abstracts for an event as a "Programme" on the main event page tick the "Display programme" check box on the edit event page.
</p>
<p>

Setting the order of abstracts
</p>
<p>

To set the order of abstracts in the programme, edit the abstracts and set their "Presentation number" field with something numerical. The smaller the number the higher in the list it will be. i.e. 1.0 will come above 1.1
</p>
<h2>Conferences (Complext events with sessions)</h2>
<p>

More complex events can be tiered into an event which contains sessions, sub sessions and then abstracts.  As soon as an event has a session connected to it, it is considered a complex event (such as a conference).  The programme listing on the main page of the event will then show the sessions which make up the event.
</p>
<p>

To create a session, click the "Create session" link in the event management block, if you create it this way from within an Event, the event will already be linked. If you try and create sessions from the black admin menu you will have to specify the event yourself.
</p>
<p>

To create a sub-session, go to the session page that you want to add a sub section to and click, 'Create sub session' from the Event Management block. This will automatically link the subsection to that section. If you create the sub session from the black admin menu at the top then you will have to specify the session yourself.
</p>
<p>

To link an abstract to a sub session, click on the "All abstracts" link in the Event management block from within the session.  This will list all the abstracts, click edit next to the abstract you wish to link to a sub session and then choose the sub session from the dropdown list.
</p>
<p>

Non session time table elements
</p>
<p>

Non session timetable elements like "Lunch" and "Welcome" can be added as another session. When you create this session tick the "Time table element" tick box which will still show these items in the programme but they will not have a link.
</p>
<p>

Setting the order of sessions
</p>
<p>

On the event main page, sessions are listed by start date order first then by the order field on the session.  If you have two sessions with the same start time, you can set their order by setting the order value of the first session to be smaller than the second.
</p>
